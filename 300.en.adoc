== Capacity development tools and approaches

GBIF employs and documents a variety of methods that contribute to objectives of this framework, and are implemented in line with GBIF’s values.

=== Supporting node development through collaboration

The GBIF Participant Node Managers Committee serves as both an advisory committee to the Governing Board and as “a forum for sharing information about the status and best practices of Participants’ nodes” (see https://www.gbif.org/document/80571/terms-of-reference-for-the-participant-node-managers-committee-nodes[Terms of Reference^]). Nodes play an essential role in developing the capacity of institutions and individuals within their network and in connecting to the national and regional levels. The nodes must also evolve their scope to keep pace with changes within GBIF itself and in the broader biodiversity landscape. GBIF places strong emphasis on capacity development support for the nodes through exchange of experience and expertise, as described in <<table-1,Table 1>>.

=== Capacity development programmes

GBIF has run various capacity development programmes since its inception, with the scale and scope of these programmes expanding over time. These programmes are centred around open calls for proposals and combine other capacity development activities, such as training workshops and webinars. Implementation is supported by the GBIF community of practice and Participant nodes that assist in promoting the calls, reviewing applications, providing mentoring and training support, and often partnering in projects. The role and types of programmes currently in use are described in table 2.

*Table 2: Capacity development through programmes*

*https://www.gbif.org/bid[Biodiversity Information for Development^] (BID)*
|===
| Description | Contributions to capacity development

|Launched in 2015, the BID programme aims to improve biodiversity data availability and accessibility in developing countries, to support national and global objectives on conservation and sustainable development. It supports projects selected following an open call process, with training and technical guidance provided by GBIF, regional support teams and partners. The programme is funded primarily by the European Union.
|The BID programme aims to enhance all levels of capacity (individual, institutional, national and regional) for effective mobilization and use of biodiversity data in research and policy in developing countries, through the nurturing of communities of practice in open data mobilization and use.
|===

*https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals[Hosted portals^]*
|===
| Description | Contributions to capacity development

|The GBIF hosted portals programme delivers simple, customizable portals to support GBIF Participant nodes, data publishing networks and institutions. These simple websites are hosted and maintained on the GBIF infrastructure and complement other more complex tools available in the network. Participation in the programme is free of charge and applications are welcome at any time.
|The programme lowers the technical threshold for maintaining a branded web presence displaying a targeted subset of GBIF-mediated data. Community calls organized by the Secretariat foster collaboration among portal groups, encouraging knowledge sharing and feature innovation.
|===

*Other Participant-led capacity development actions*
|===
| Description | Contributions to capacity development

|GBIF Participants lead many capacity development programmes and initiatives that range in scale from local workshops to international funding programmes. GBIF facilitates such actions by providing access to training resources and guidance materials, supporting the organization of training workshops and engaging volunteer mentors and trainers.
|The Secretariat supports the implementation of Participant-led capacity development actions that are aligned with GBIF’s vision, mission and strategic priority areas.

=== Community of practice support and development

GBIF has defined roles within a broad community of GBIF volunteers to assist them in contributing effectively and to ensure recognition for their contributions.  According to the https://www.gbif.org/news/5WZThcL928vmPnSvrGhZfE/[2023 Deloitte Access Economics valuation and assessment of the impact of the GBIF network^], the value of time contributed by volunteers through various activities such as translation or mentoring is worth nearly €1 million per year.

GBIF’s regional support teams, comprised of contractors who work part-time from within their target regions, further assist the development of the community of practice, particularly in non-Participant countries. This work was started in response to recommendations in CODATA's https://www.gbif.org/news/1QfpUlGByxjqBktiYAfyIK/[Twenty-Year Review of GBIF^], including strengthening the nodes by stabilizing and extending the regional networks. These regional support teams complement the work done by community volunteers and work in close collaboration with the nodes and the elected regional representatives to strengthen the coordination of regional participation in GBIF.

*Table 3: Supporting the development of the community of practice*

*GBIF volunteer community*
|===
| Description | Contributions to capacity development

|GBIF assigns roles to volunteers contributing as https://www.gbif.org/mentors[mentors and trainers^], https://www.gbif.org/ambassadors[biodiversity open data ambassadors^], reviewers and https://www.gbif.org/translators[translators^]. Volunteers assist in developing and delivering training, speaking on GBIF’s behalf at relevant conferences and meetings, providing impartial reviews and feedback on applications to programmes, and translating materials and content to make GBIF fully accessible to our global community.
|Mentors and trainers help others within the community of practice to build the skills needed to achieve the network's common goals by volunteering their knowledge and expertise. Ambassadors advocate best practices in open sharing and transparent use of biodiversity data and promote GBIF in national and regional venues. Translators reduce linguistic barriers to support effective participation in capacity development actions. Reviewers provide impartial guidance in reviewing proposals and their feedback to applicants helps to develop capacity for project preparation and implementation. All volunteers develop their own capacity through their participation in these roles.
|===

*Regional support teams*
|===
| Description | Contributions to capacity development

|The regional support teams aid in the development of active communities of practice with the organization of online training workshops; provide technical assistance to data publishers by helping administrating regional cloud IPTs, reviewing the quality of datasets prepared by new GBIF publishers and organizing regular open office hours; and support the discovery and engagement of biodiversity data holding institutions by updating the Global Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl) and establishing contact with data holders to communicate the benefits of open data sharing.
|This supports the development of individual and institutional capacity in non-GBIF Participant countries and helps pilot new GBIF-led initiatives to assess impact. 
Working in close collaboration with the GBIF Secretariat and the regional representatives to ensure the alignment of their work with GBIF-led initiatives, they maximize the reach of the GBIF Secretariat to support the development of dynamic communities of practice.

=== Training strategy and learning resources

GBIF offers a blended learning environment that provides reusable and easily accessible learning opportunities, both online and in-person, that can be implemented across all levels of this capacity development framework. The GBIF Secretariat guides the development and maintenance of curricula and a catalogue of resources that further the goals to mobilize data through GBIF and to use GBIF-mediated data in research and decision-making. The resources exist in the form of courses, tutorials, instructional videos, and digital documentation. The Secretariat and nodes collaborate with a range of volunteers, community experts, and higher education in the development, delivery, promotion and use of materials and courses. The Secretariat partners with established external groups to provide essential foundational skills that are needed in the community. 

*Table 4: Training and documentation*

****
*Curriculum development*
|===
| Description | Contributions to capacity development

|Since 2016, when the first version of the data mobilization workshop was developed for the BID programme, the Secretariat has focused on working with GBIF community experts to develop training materials that are based on defined learning objects and an educational rubric with measures of success to enable certification for selected courses.  The content is modular-based, designed to be reusable and is easily accessible online. Additional features include use cases and practical exercises; pre- and post-course activities; and pre- and post-course evaluations.
|The GBIF method of curriculum development is key in developing and expanding the  community of practice. An end result of completing GBIF courses is development of skills at an individual level that translate to the ability to reuse materials and exchange knowledge with colleagues/peers to further develop skills in their institutional and national communities.
|===

*Digital documentation*
|===
| Description | Contributions to capacity development

a|Beyond training materials, the Secretariat offers a range of best practice guides intended to supplement GBIF’s data publishing and data use communities. This digital-first documentation is on a range of topics relating to biodiversity informatics and open biodiversity data. Text and other content are maintained in open GBIF GitHub repositories and published into HTML and PDF formats using an open-source publishing toolchain called AsciiDoctor. Support for translations is integrated via CrowdIn, which provides a free non-commercial licence that supports the efforts of GBIF's volunteer translator community. GBIF’s digital-first documentation is:

- Authored by the community
- Reviewed by the community
- Consistent  
- Versioned
- Maintained on GitHub
- Updated in a timely manner
- Licenced with Creative Commons
- Translated in multiple languages

In addition to the best practice guides, the Secretariat develops and maintains technical documentation on GBIF processes, tools, services, and system components. Like the best practice guides, the technical documentation is maintained in GitHub and uses AsciiDoctor.
|Digital-first documentation promotes knowledge sharing from community experts and gives the community at-large an opportunity to peer-review. This promotes  inclusivity and transparency in the process and allows quick response to new or expanded needs from the community with regards to specific documentation. Additionally, it expands the community to new users and thematic communities.
