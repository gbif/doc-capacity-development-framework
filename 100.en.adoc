== Capacity development objectives 

Capacity is broadly defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as _“the ability of individuals, institutions, and societies to perform functions, solve problems and set and achieve objectives in a sustainable manner”_. Capacity development refers to _“the processes whereby people, organizations, and society as a whole unleash, strengthen, create, adapt and maintain capacity over time”_. These definitions are widely used in the field of international cooperation, and are applicable to GBIF.

GBIF’s strategic framework 2023-2027 sets out the global vision and mission, together with four strategic priority areas to achieve these (see box 1). Capacity development, while emphasized especially in priority area 3,  will contribute to GBIF’s success across all areas of the strategic framework.
